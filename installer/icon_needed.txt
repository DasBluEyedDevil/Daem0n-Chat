DaemonChat MCPB Icon Placeholder

To complete the MCPB Desktop Extension bundle, you need to provide an icon:

1. Create a 512x512 PNG icon file
2. Save it as: installer/icon.png
3. The icon should represent DaemonChat's conversational memory theme

This is intentionally lightweight -- the actual icon design is a user/design decision.

MCPB manifest reference: installer/manifest.json
