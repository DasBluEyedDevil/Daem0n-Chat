<objective>
Delete all obsolete coding-era documentation, skills, commands, and plugins that reference the old DaemonMCP workflow tools (commune, consult, inscribe, reflect, understand, govern, explore, maintain).

Purpose: Phase 10 success criteria #2 and #3 require no references to obsolete tools and no coding-specific skills/commands. These files are all artifacts of the pre-v1.0.0 DaemonMCP coding memory system and are completely irrelevant to the DaemonChat conversational memory system.

Output: Clean repository with no stale documentation files.

    Delete the following directories and their contents entirely:

    1. `.claude/skills/` -- contains 3 coding-era skills (daem0nmcp-protocol references commune/consult/inscribe/reflect/understand/govern/explore/maintain workflow tools; openspec-daem0n-bridge references OpenSpec integration; summon_daem0n references multi-repo setup). These are all Claude Code skills for the old DaemonMCP coding workflow. DaemonChat has no skills system.

    2. `.opencode/` -- contains 4 slash command definitions (commune.md, counsel.md, inscribe.md, recall.md) and 1 plugin (daem0n.ts covenant enforcement). These are all OpenCode integrations for old DaemonMCP tools. DaemonChat does not support OpenCode.

    3. `.claude-plugin/` -- contains plugin.json referencing "daem0nmcp v2.6.0" with description "AI memory system with semantic understanding - provides persistent memory, decision trees, and outcome tracking". This is the old Claude Desktop plugin manifest. DaemonChat uses Inno Setup installer, not plugin manifests.

    4. `docs/` -- contains index.html (old visual dashboard HTML), favicon.ico, and multi-repo-setup.md (references commune/consult/inscribe/maintain tools). All coding-era artifacts.

    Use `rm -rf` for each top-level directory. After deletion, verify the directories no longer exist.

    Note: The `.claude/` directory itself should remain (it may be used by Claude Code for other purposes), but `.claude/skills/` should be fully removed.

    Run the following checks:
    - `ls .claude/skills/ 2>/dev/null` should produce no output
    - `ls .opencode/ 2>/dev/null` should produce no output
    - `ls .claude-plugin/ 2>/dev/null` should produce no output
    - `ls docs/ 2>/dev/null` should produce no output
    - `git status` should show all the deleted files

  <done>All four directories (.claude/skills/, .opencode/, .claude-plugin/, docs/) and their contents are deleted from the working tree.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify no remaining references to obsolete tools in tracked files</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Search the entire repository (excluding .venv/, node_modules/, .planning/, .git/, .test_tmp/) for any remaining references to the 8 obsolete workflow tool names: commune, consult, inscribe, reflect, understand, govern, explore, maintain.

    Specifically search for:
    - Tool function names: `commune(`, `consult(`, `inscribe(`, `reflect(`, `understand(`, `govern(`, `explore(`, `maintain(`
    - MCP tool references: `mcp__daem0nmcp__commune`, `mcp__daem0nmcp__consult`, etc.
    - OpenCode tool references: `daem0nmcp_commune`, `daem0nmcp_consult`, etc.
    - Workflow import references: `from daem0nmcp.workflows.commune`, etc.

    IMPORTANT: The words "commune", "reflect", "explore", "maintain" etc. may appear legitimately in:
    - Python source code as part of the existing codebase (old workflow modules that still exist in `daem0nmcp/workflows/` -- these are CODE, not documentation, and are NOT in scope for this plan)
    - Git history / commit messages
    - .planning/ files (internal planning docs, not user-facing)

    This task only needs to verify that NO USER-FACING documentation files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, any .md files outside .planning/) reference the old tools. The README.md and CHANGELOG.md will be rewritten in Plan 10-02, so flag them but do not modify them here.

    Report findings. If any unexpected files reference old tools, note them for the summary.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run: `grep -r "commune\|consult\|inscribe\|govern" --include="*.md" . 2>/dev/null | grep -v ".planning/" | grep -v ".venv/" | grep -v "node_modules/"`

    The only matches should be in README.md and CHANGELOG.md (which Plan 10-02 will rewrite).
  </verify>
  <done>Audit confirms that after Plan 10-01 deletions, the only remaining user-facing files with old tool references are README.md and CHANGELOG.md (addressed by Plan 10-02).</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `ls .claude/skills/ .opencode/ .claude-plugin/ docs/ 2>&1` should show "No such file or directory" for all four
- No .md files outside .planning/ reference old DaemonMCP workflow tools (except README.md and CHANGELOG.md which are Plan 10-02's scope)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All coding-era skills, commands, plugins, and docs directories are deleted
- Audit confirms no stray references to obsolete tools in non-planning documentation
- Repository is clean for Plan 10-02 to write fresh documentation
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-documentation-cleanup/10-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
