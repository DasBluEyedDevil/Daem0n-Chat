<objective>
Write fresh README.md and CHANGELOG.md for DaemonChat v1.0.0, replacing the entire old DaemonMCP coding-era documentation with accurate descriptions of the conversational memory system.

Purpose: Phase 10 success criteria #1 (README describes DaemonChat) and #4 (CHANGELOG documents v1.0.0). The current README.md is 1120 lines of DaemonMCP v6.6.6 coding tool documentation -- completely wrong for this product.

Output: README.md and CHANGELOG.md that accurately represent the shipped DaemonChat v1.0.0 conversational memory system.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write new README.md for DaemonChat v1.0.0</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Replace the entire README.md with a fresh document for DaemonChat v1.0.0. The README must be written for the TARGET AUDIENCE: non-technical Claude Desktop users who want Claude to remember them.

    Structure the README as follows:

    **1. Header and tagline**
    - Project name: DaemonChat (not DaemonMCP, not Daem0nMCP)
    - Tagline: Persistent conversational memory for Claude Desktop
    - Core value proposition: "Claude remembers you. No blank slate, no forgetting. Every conversation builds on the last."

    **2. What This Does (2-3 paragraphs)**
    - DaemonChat is a local MCP server that gives Claude Desktop persistent memory
    - It remembers your name, interests, concerns, relationships, communication style
    - Every conversation builds context -- Claude greets you naturally, follows up on unresolved threads, adapts its tone to match yours
    - All data stays on your machine (privacy-first, no cloud)

    **3. Features (bulleted list)**
    Key capabilities built across 9 phases:
    - Conversational memory with 10 categories (fact, preference, concern, milestone, relationship, emotion, goal, context, event, topic)
    - Per-user isolation (multiple users, each with private memory)
    - Explicit memory control ("remember this", "forget that", "what do you know about me?")
    - Auto-detection of important information from natural conversation
    - Session continuity (natural greetings, topic follow-up, unresolved thread detection)
    - Emotional context tracking (remembers how you felt, not just what you said)
    - Personal knowledge graph (people, places, pets, relationships with multi-hop queries)
    - Adaptive communication style (learns your formality, verbosity, emoji preferences)
    - Conversation summarization with session boundaries

    **4. Installation**
    Two paths:
    - **Windows (recommended for non-technical users):** Download the Inno Setup installer from Releases, run it. It handles Python, dependencies, model download, and Claude Desktop configuration automatically. Installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DaemonChat\`.
    - **Developer install (all platforms):** `pip install -e .` then configure Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json` to point at the server. Provide the JSON snippet:
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "DaemonChat": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["-m", "daem0nmcp.server"]
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      Note: Both `daem0nmcp` and `daem0nchat` console entry points work (backward compatibility).

    **5. The 8 Tools**
    Document ALL 8 daem0n_* tools. For each tool, provide: name, one-line description, and key actions/parameters. Use a table format:

    | Tool | Purpose |
    |------|---------|
    | `daem0n_briefing` | Session start -- greets user by name, surfaces recent context, unresolved threads, and follow-up suggestions |
    | `daem0n_remember` | Store a memory -- auto-categorized with emotion detection, style analysis, and duplicate prevention |
    | `daem0n_recall` | Retrieve memories by topic -- hybrid BM25 + vector search with temporal context |
    | `daem0n_forget` | Delete memories -- by ID, semantic search query, or batch confirmation |
    | `daem0n_profile` | User management -- set name, switch users, get/set preferences, onboard, introspect stored data |
    | `daem0n_relate` | Knowledge graph -- link entities, find connections, query relationships ("what do you know about my sister?") |
    | `daem0n_reflect` | Reflect on memories -- find related patterns and connections |
    | `daem0n_status` | Server health -- version, statistics, storage info |

    Claude invokes these tools automatically during conversation. Users do NOT need to call them manually.

    **6. How It Works (brief)**
    - Runs as a local MCP server alongside Claude Desktop
    - Stores data in SQLite + Qdrant (local vector database) at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DaemonChat\` (Windows) or standard platform paths
    - Uses ModernBERT embeddings for semantic search
    - Memory decay ensures casual mentions fade while important facts persist
    - All processing happens locally -- no data leaves your machine

    **7. Privacy**
    - All data stored locally on your machine
    - No cloud sync, no telemetry, no external API calls with your data
    - You control everything -- use `daem0n_forget` or delete the storage directory

    **8. Development**
    Brief section for contributors:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    pytest tests/ -v --asyncio-mode=auto
    ```

  <name>Task 2: Write new CHANGELOG.md for v1.0.0</name>
  <files>CHANGELOG.md</files>
  <action>
    Replace the entire CHANGELOG.md with a fresh document starting at v1.0.0. The old changelog documented DaemonMCP v2.x through v6.x coding-era releases -- none of that is relevant.

    Structure:

    ```markdown
    # Changelog

    ## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-08

    DaemonChat v1.0.0 -- Persistent conversational memory for Claude Desktop.

    Branched from the DaemonMCP coding memory engine and rebuilt for personal, conversational use.

    ### Core Features
    - **Conversational Memory**: 10 memory categories (fact, preference, concern, milestone, relationship, emotion, goal, context, event, topic) with multi-category support
    - **8 MCP Tools**: daem0n_briefing, daem0n_remember, daem0n_recall, daem0n_forget, daem0n_profile, daem0n_relate, daem0n_reflect, daem0n_status
    - **Per-User Isolation**: Multiple users with completely isolated memory storage
    - **User Profiles**: Store personal facts, preferences, and identity with profile management

    ### Memory Intelligence
    - **Auto-Detection**: Automatic extraction of names, relationships, concerns, interests from natural conversation with confidence-based filtering
    - **Emotion Detection**: Three-tier emotion recognition (explicit statements, emphasis patterns, topic sentiment) with memory enrichment
    - **Memory Decay**: Per-category decay rates -- explicit memories persist, casual mentions fade naturally
    - **Duplicate Prevention**: Content similarity checking before storage

    ### Session Experience
    - **Conversational Briefing**: Natural greetings with name, recent context, and temporal awareness ("3 weeks ago you mentioned...")
    - **Thread Detection**: Priority-scored unresolved thread identification with follow-up type classification
    - **Session Summarization**: Automatic session summaries with topic extraction and emotional tone
    - **Greeting Guidance**: Tone-aware greeting suggestions based on previous session emotional context

    ### Knowledge & Relationships
    - **Personal Knowledge Graph**: Entity extraction for people, places, pets, organizations with alias resolution
    - **Multi-Hop Queries**: Relational recall across entity connections ("what about my sister's dog?")
    - **Relationship References**: Automatic alias creation from relationship mentions ("my sister Sarah")

    ### Adaptive Personality
    - **Style Detection**: Four-dimension analysis (formality, verbosity, emoji usage, expressiveness)
    - **EMA-Smoothed Profiles**: Gradual style adaptation using exponential moving averages
    - **Style Guidance**: Briefing includes communication style recommendations for natural interaction

    ### Distribution
    - **Inno Setup Installer**: One-click Windows installer with embedded Python, CPU-only PyTorch, pre-downloaded model
    - **Claude Desktop Integration**: Automatic configuration of claude_desktop_config.json
    - **Dual Entry Points**: Both `daem0nmcp` and `daem0nchat` console scripts

    ### Infrastructure (inherited from DaemonMCP)
    - Hybrid search (BM25 + ModernBERT vector embeddings with RRF fusion)
    - Local SQLite + Qdrant vector storage
    - Knowledge graph with Leiden community detection
    - Memory decay model with configurable half-lives
    - Background dreaming for memory consolidation
    - LLMLingua-2 context compression
    ```

    Keep the entire changelog to this single v1.0.0 entry. Do NOT include old DaemonMCP version history (v2.x-v6.x). This is a new product.
