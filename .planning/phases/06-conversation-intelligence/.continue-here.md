<current_state>
Phase 6 is COMPLETE. Both plans executed, verified, and committed. Ready for Phase 7.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- 06-01: Emotion detection module + memory enrichment - Complete
  - Created `daem0nmcp/emotion_detect.py` with 3 detection methods
  - Wired enrichment into `daem0n_remember.py` before storage
  - 13 tests added, all pass
  - Commits: 2ccc973, a7bb54a

- 06-02: Session summarization + briefing integration - Complete
  - Created `_build_previous_session_summary()` with 2-hour time-gap heuristic
  - Added tone-aware greeting guidance with `_NEGATIVE_TONES` frozenset
  - Integrated into `_build_user_briefing()`
  - 13 tests added, all pass
  - Commits: 9bbb6a9, 58d333e, 9525647

- Phase verification: Complete
  - All 11 must-haves verified
  - 06-VERIFICATION.md created with PASSED status
  - ROADMAP.md and STATE.md updated
  - Commit: e6a115d

<remaining_work>

Phase 6 is complete. No remaining work in this phase.

Next phase: Phase 7 (Knowledge Graph Adaptation)
- Personal relationship graph with multi-hop recall
- Entity resolution for references
- Plans not yet created (TBD in roadmap)

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Three-tier emotion detection: explicit (0.95) > emphasis (0.65-0.85) > topic (0.60)
- 50+ acronyms excluded from emphasis detection (AI, SQL, API, etc.)
- Emotion enrichment runs on ALL memories, not just auto-detected
- SESSION_GAP_HOURS=2 for session boundary detection
- sessions[0] is previous session since briefing runs at conversation start
- 18 negative tones in _NEGATIVE_TONES for greeting tone awareness

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. Phase complete.

<context>
Phase 6 delivered conversation intelligence with two capabilities:

1. **Emotion detection** - Rule-based detector with three methods (explicit statements like "I'm stressed", emphasis patterns like ALL CAPS, topic sentiment like "funeral" or "promotion"). Auto-enriches memories with emotion category and tags.

2. **Session summarization** - At briefing time, generates a 1-3 sentence summary of the previous session including topics discussed, emotional tone, and unresolved threads. Uses 2-hour time-gap to detect session boundaries.

Both integrate seamlessly with existing briefing and memory storage pipelines.

<next_action>
Start Phase 7 planning with: `/gsd:plan-phase 7`

Phase 7 will add knowledge graph adaptation for personal relationships:
- Entity storage (people, places, pets, organizations)
- Relationship types (knows, lives_in, works_at, owns, related_to)
- Multi-hop recall ("What do you know about my sister's dog?")
- Entity resolution ("Sarah", "my sister", "her" -> same node)
</next_action>
